# 30-days-of-Kotlin-with-Google
Final project submission...

This app coded in Kotlin is used to generate two dice images when the roll button is pressed...and then shows the sum of both the dice numbers.
This has been achieved using the Random class in Java..that generates pseudo random int numbers.
